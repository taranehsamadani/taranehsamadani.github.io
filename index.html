              <p class="bio"> Hi! I am a sophomore at Viriginia Tech in a Writing and Digital Media Class. We have began learning about html and css coding. This is a website we created via these new learnings. I have never really done anything like this before because I am a Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience major so this is very new, cool, and exciting. I really do love learning new things so please feel free to browse this website and take a look at the progress I have made so far in the class!

          <h2>iPads: the new pencil and paper?</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I hadn't seen or thought about iPad's since I was in middle school. Now, as a college student I am seeing iPads everywhere. It seems like everyone has made the jump to using an iPad for notes rather than the traditional notebook. I had to see what the rave was about so I did a little research; <a href="https://medium.com/@tsamadani/ipads-the-new-pencil-and-paper-6d9e1074c684" target="_blank">iPad's: The New Pencil and Paper?</a>. My question is...are they all that? </p>

          <h2>The Lyrebirds Podcast: Don't F*ck With Cats</h2>
          <p class="description">
            It is no secret that social media has had an intense effect on the ways that people view the world around them. In terms of serious matters, including crime coverage and the opinions surrounding it, there is absolutely no exception. A discussion between students, who are very aware of the media and how it works and how the use of social media has had an effect on well-known crimes of the past, showcases just how this trend can continue to affect the motions and outcomes of crimes of the future. In this podcast,   <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vndalsavage911/the-lyrebirds-podcast-dont-fck-with-cats?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">The Lyrebids Pocast: Don't F*ck With Cats</a>, we discuss the popular Netflix documentary and how it relates to the social media as a whole.

              <p class="bio"> Welcome!! I am a sophomore at Viriginia Tech pursing a undergraduate degree in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience. My general passions are reading, playing lacrosse, and studying the brain! I hope to one day either become a Physcian Assistant or conduct research and get my Ph.D in Cognitive Neuroscience. I am currently in a Writing and Digital Media class where we have learned how to code in HTML and CSS. This is a website we created via these new learnings. I have never really done anything like this before so this is very new, cool, and exciting. I really do love learning new things so please feel free to browse this website and take a look at the progress I have made so far in the class!

          <p class="description">
            I hadn't seen or thought about iPad's since I was in middle school. Now, as a college student I am seeing iPads everywhere. It seems like everyone has made the jump to using an iPad for notes rather than the traditional notebook. I had to see what the rave was about so I did a little research; <a href="https://medium.com/@tsamadani/ipads-the-new-pencil-and-paper-6d9e1074c684" target="_blank">iPad's: The New Pencil and Paper?</a>. My question is...are they all that? </p>

            It is no secret that social media has had an intense effect on the ways that people view the world around them. In terms of serious matters, including crime coverage and the opinions surrounding it, there is absolutely no exception. A discussion between students, who are very aware of the media and how it works and how the use of social media has had an effect on well-known crimes of the past, showcases just how this trend can continue to affect the motions and outcomes of crimes of the future. In this podcast,   <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vndalsavage911/the-lyrebirds-podcast-dont-fck-with-cats?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">The Lyrebids Pocast: Don't F*ck With Cats</a>, we discuss the popular Netflix documentary and how it relates to the social media as a whole.

          <h2>Video Project</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My video project showcases a sport that is my greatest passion. I have been playing lacrosse since I was six years old and am so thankful to be able to continue playing in college. The Virginia Tech Women's Club Lacrosse Team has become such a family for me. In this video I will show you a few <a href="https://youtu.be/5kt1snKPTuw">Basic Lacrosse Tips</a> and skills that you will need if you want to start playing. Please enjoy!! .</p>

          <h2>Research Paper</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My freshman year of college I had to write a research paper on something I was passionate about that related to the media. I chose to write about the dangers or media and technology for children. I think that many of the new social medias apps, like Tik Tok, are very damaging for the youth. The article is aimed toward <a href="https://virginiatech-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/tsamadani_vt_edu/ESC4hbG4xm9LjlVSKgbmAi0BvFgvKx98MUDfI-jIELx1EA?e=DfkSfO">Keeping Kids Safe on Technology and the Media</a>. I know a lot of people may not agree with my position on this topic, but I think it is important for parents to really think about what they are allowing their children to view and monitor how much screen time they are getting.</p>
